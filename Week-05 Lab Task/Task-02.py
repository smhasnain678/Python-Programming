# Q2. Number Guessing Game 
# Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 and 9. 

# Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt 
# appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well 
# guessed!" message, and the program will exit.

# Import the 'random' module to generate random numbers 
import random

# Generate a random number between 1 and 10 (inclusive) as the target number 
target_num, guess_num = random.randint(1, 10), 0

# Start a loop that continues until the guessed number matches the target number 
while target_num != guess_num:
     # Prompt the user to input a number between 1 and 10 and convert it to an integer 
     guess_num = int(input('Guess a number between 1 and 10 until you get it right: '))
      
# Print a message indicating successful guessing once the correct number is guessed 
print("Well guessed!")
