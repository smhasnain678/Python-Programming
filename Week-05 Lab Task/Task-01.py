# Q1. Divisible by 7 and Multiples of 5

# Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiples of 
# 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included). 

# Create an empty list to store numbers that meet the given conditions

nl = []

# Iterate through numbers from 1500 to 2700 (inclusive) 

for x in range(1500, 2701):
     # Check if the number is divisible by 7 and 5 without any remainder
     if(x % 7 == 0) and (x % 5 == 0):
          # If the conditions are met, convert the number to a string and append it to the list 
          nl.append(str(x))
          
# Join the numbers in the list with a comma and print the result 
print(','.join(nl))
